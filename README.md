## Hi there!
Here is a C#-converted repository of [SimpleDynoHS](https://github.com/jahonen75/SimpleDynoHS) developed by [jahonen75](https://github.com/jahonen75).  
The [SimpleDyno](https://github.com/kjellegafvelin/SimpleDyno) initially developed by [DamoRC](https://github.com/kjellegafvelin) and continued by [Lassi Niemistö](https://github.com/lassi-niemisto) but I have no way to reach them. I've just confirmed with jahonen75 if it’s okay to start this project (then I can show this). So this repository may be erased by precursor's request.  

## Status  

\- The code is based on the code "SimpleDynoHS" 0.0.1 (that might based on original SimpleDyno ver 6.5.3?) but the code is not "forked". Almost all code are copied then converted. When they update the "SimpleDynoHS", I will check the change should be applied here.  
\- The manual work I did is noted in `addendum for SimpleDynoCS.md` in `Instructions and Docs and Release Zip File` directory. The file `Instructions for using SimpleDyno 6.5.docx` is untouched.
\- Currently the code is just translated from VisualBasic to C# using code converter and some manual works. I did not touch `arduino` directory but removed `My Project` directory. Is it required?  
\- It is now on .Net8 but still uses WindowsForms as UI control. It can be compiled by VisualStudio 2022. All resources like icons, pictures, forms are not changed.  
\- The code can be compiled and be invoked. Some pages appear normally but I cannot check whether it works or not (especially serial I/O and sound port) because I have no dyno hardware.  

Reason why this repository does not have licenses is previous projects did not. But same as usual, the code is provided as-is base. I do not take any responsibilities when you try to use this. No warranty, no one owe any duties.  

Now I start looking for how to make dyno.
